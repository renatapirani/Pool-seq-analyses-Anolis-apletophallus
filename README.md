# Population sequencing analyses (Pool-Seq) from _Anolis apletophallus_

The slender anole lizards _Anolis apletophallus_ exhibit a dewlap polymorphism that males either have a solid entirely orange dewlap (solid morph) or a white margin dewlap with an orange middle spot (bicolor morph). To understand the inheritance of this polymorphism, we conducted breeding experiments to determine the mode of inheritance for these two dewlap color patterns in slender anole. We also investigate the genetic basis of this species' dewlap polymorphism using a pooled population sequencing (Pool-Seq) experiment.
